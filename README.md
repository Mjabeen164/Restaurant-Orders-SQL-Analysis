# 🍽️ Restaurant Orders Analysis  

This project analyzes a quarter's worth of fictitious restaurant orders from an international cuisine restaurant. The dataset includes order dates, times, items purchased, categories, cuisine types, and prices. Using **SQL**, I explored ordering trends, customer spending behavior, and menu performance.

## 📊 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to uncover insights from restaurant sales data to help improve menu design, pricing, and business strategy.  

Key questions explored:  
1. **Most & least ordered items** – Which menu items are most popular and which underperform?  
2. **Item categories** – What types of items (appetizers, mains, desserts, drinks, etc.) dominate orders?  
3. **High-spend orders** – What do the biggest orders look like (items purchased and total spend)?  
4. **Order timing** – Which times of day or days of the week have higher/lower order volume?  
5. **Cuisine performance** – Which cuisines are most in demand, and which need further menu development?

## 🔍 Insights & Findings  
- **Most ordered items** were from [insert category once identified, e.g., "main courses like pasta and burgers"].  
- **Least ordered items** were [insert items, e.g., "specialty soups and some desserts"].  
- **High-value orders** often included multiple items across categories (e.g., combo of main dish, dessert, and drinks).  
- **Peak ordering times** aligned with [insert times, e.g., "lunch (12–2 PM) and dinner (6–8 PM)"].  
- **Cuisine performance** → [e.g., "Italian and Asian dishes were most popular, while Mediterranean items were less frequently ordered"].
